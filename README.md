# proxmox-pve-tools
Collection of utilities I've written for Proxmox PVE maintenance.

It works for me, and I share them with the rest of the world. Consider them as alpha quality - without warranty.

## qcow2-check
QCOW2 files are very performant, bud badly protected. It may happen that the file gets corrupted, sometimes unrecoverable, and it often happens while creating a snapshot. Such damage can be prevented by checking the QCOW2 file. It is safe to run this check on running VM disks, but it might appear some false positive. Image get be checked as leaked, and then come back to OK. Anyway, a corrupted status is not good and the image should be moved as soon as possible.

If a file is detected as damaged, move it to storage (using the disk move function in Proxmox), and it will get fixed.

## qcow2-check-all
This script will search QCOW2 files in all the defined storage paths, and then check them with qcow2-check.

## qm-rename
Renaming a KVM machine requires a bit of work. This script will do the job
* works only with QCOW2 files (local of NFS)
* move also the backups
* move the VM in a group of VMs

## ssl-check
If you did change the SSL certificates with yours, adding a machine can be painful. This script will check that all the SSL keys and certificated match, and warn in case of error.

## ssl-gen-csr-for-myself
If you want to use your own certificates, you might want to generate a CSR file. In such case, join the cluster using « pvecm add », and you will get an error telling that the certificate cannot be generated. Once done, run this script on the new machine, and you will get the CSR to sign by your CA. This script requires the « openssl.cnf » file in the same folder.
